I am learning web application development skills.
I have decided to walk through this course on -> https://youtu.be/dX8396ZmSPk on HTML and CSS for web dev

I want to use this course to move from design to deployment of a web app.

Every week, I will spend three days of the week working on this skill.

Connected, I will be working on a single data structure question in prep for an interview in a software company.
